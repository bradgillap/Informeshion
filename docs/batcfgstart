# Adding a gateweay for Internet connection, re-transmit nodes will attempt to forward back to the dhcp server to route through the
# gateway address. This would be a useful configuration option. 

# In this scenario we are running a dhcp serever and we know the internet speed which helps transmitters make better decisions for routing.
# If you don't know the Internet speed you can leave out the speed.

# To run a node without that doesn't have dhcp but still connects to a gateweay

#Informational gateweay mode of the current node.

# If two retransmit nodes are connected to the server, we can isolate them from each other to avoid chatter/collisions with ap isolation.
