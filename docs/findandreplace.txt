sed -i 's/original/new/g' file.txt
Explanation:

sed = Stream EDitor
-i = in-place (i.e. save back to the original file)
The command string:

s = the substitute command
original = a regular expression describing the word to replace (or just the word itself)
new = the text to replace it with
g = global (i.e. replace all and not just the first occurrence)
file.txt = the file name

What happens is, you are replacing exactly "#interface=" without touching the text that's before and after it on the same line.
Make it target the whole line for replacement like this:
s/^#interface=.*$/interface=wlan0/
Explanation for ^#interface=.*$:
^ is beginning of line
#interface= is normal text
. is any character, * means repeated any number of times
$ is end of line
You don't need the g at the end of the s//.
